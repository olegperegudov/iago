# Changelog

Engineering release notes. Primary reader: future Claude. Detailed on purpose —
enough to understand *what* changed and *why* without digging through diffs.

## Unreleased

**⌘E draws on a screenshot without leaving the history.** Marking up a capture meant finding the file on disk, opening it, drawing, saving, and copying it back — five steps outside the app that has the picture in its hand. Now the cursor stands on a picture card, `⌘E` hands it to Preview's markup tools, and every save there comes back as a new clip: the marked-up version is the newest card and already on the clipboard, the untouched original is the card behind it. That last part is why the edit does not go into the clip's own file — the history owns `img/<id>.png`, and an editor saving over it would silently rewrite a card the user is still looking at. A copy goes out instead, named by id so editing the same clip twice reuses the document Preview already has open.

- **The copy goes to a folder inside Downloads, because that is the only place Preview may write.** Preview is sandboxed: it holds `com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write` and nothing broader, so a file handed to it anywhere else opens and draws normally and then swallows the save — no error, no prompt on close, and the file on disk byte-for-byte what we wrote. The first build put copies under Application Support and did exactly that (2026-08-06: `⌘E` opened Preview, the drawing was made, `⌘S` `⌘W` pressed, and the file's hash and mtime were untouched; the same picture in Downloads saved fine). Copies are named `iago-<id>.png`, and both the watcher and the sweep ignore anything in that folder without the prefix — it is the user's Downloads, and what they put there is theirs.
- **Preview by name, not "whatever opens PNGs".** The default handler for a PNG can be a viewer with nothing to draw with; Preview is where macOS ships arrows, boxes, text and crop. Windows has no equivalent, so there the picture goes to the user's own handler (Paint, by default, which draws).
- **The copy we hand out must not come back as an edit.** It is byte-for-byte a clip the history already holds, so filing it would bump that card to the top and relabel it as an edit that never happened. A short ring of content hashes (`edit::Known`) is what the watcher checks against. Keyed by content rather than by path on purpose: the watcher reports the folder's resolved path, which is not the one we wrote to when a symlink is in the way — `/var` against `/private/var` is what the test caught. The same ring swallows the burst of filesystem events one save arrives as, so a save costs one decode, not four.
- **Remembered before it is written**, not after: the watcher is already running, and the only thing that would otherwise keep it from filing our own copy is the fraction of a second it spends waiting for the write to settle.
- **`intake.rs`** now holds what the screenshot watcher and the edit watcher were both about to do — wait for the write to finish, read the size out of the PNG, put it on the clipboard ahead of the history. `screenshot.rs` keeps only its own event loop and shrank by about half.
- **The key is matched on the physical key, not the letter it prints.** On a Russian layout that key prints "у", and a rule written against the letter is one that quietly stops working when the layout changes — the same class of bug that once turned a synthetic ⌘V into ⌘A. `keyAction` takes `code` alongside `key`; both spellings are tested.
- **On a text card ⌘E does nothing at all** rather than opening a text file nobody asked for, and on the app row there is no card selected to open.
- Edited pictures get their own source (`Edited`), so the app row filters down to just the edits — and so the card never claims to have come from whichever editor happened to be frontmost when the file landed.
- Copies are swept at startup once they are a day old. Not on pickup: a second ⌘S has to still find the file it is saving into.
- Tests: the loop end to end behind a real filesystem watcher (`cargo test -- --ignored a_saved_picture` — ignored by default because filing a clip puts it on the real clipboard), the ring's bound, and the keyboard rules. The popup half is checked headlessly through the app's own state machine (`web_eye/_iago_edit_check.mjs`): which card the key acts on, that it survives a Russian layout, and that text cards and the app row are left alone.

**The README says out loud what Iago is an alternative to.** Nobody hunting for a clipboard manager searches for "Iago" — they search for a free alternative to [Paste](https://pasteapp.io), the paid app whose card-per-clip layout this one grew out of. A line under the title names it and links to it, which is what a search engine reads, and the foot of the page states the project is independent and the name belongs to its owner. Naming a product to say what yours is like is fair use; implying a blessing from its makers is not — so no logo of theirs, no screenshot of theirs, and the name stays out of ours, the repository's and the domain.

**⌥V claims itself again every five minutes.** The hotkey was claimed once, at launch, and macOS can take that claim back without telling anyone: after four days of uptime the app sat in the tray looking healthy — clipboard watcher filing clips to the second, fifty clips in the history — while the only way in was gone. The log's last `hotkey:` line was eleven hours old; a restart brought it straight back. Nothing inside the app can see the loss, either: the plugin's `is_registered` answers from its own bookkeeping, not from the system, so it says "yes" about a hotkey the system has already forgotten. There is therefore nothing to check and no event to react to — the claim is simply released and taken again on a timer, which repairs the invisible case and costs nothing in the healthy one. Five minutes rather than one: the renewal sleeps in an async task holding no power assertion, so the Mac still sleeps, and a worst case of five dead minutes is shorter than the time it takes to notice. Registration lives in one function now (`claim_hotkey`), used by both launch and renewal, so the two cannot drift apart — and it unregisters before registering, because a claim that is still live is refused and a claim the system dropped is exactly what needs replacing. Only a failed renewal is logged; a quiet log means the hotkey is where it belongs.

**The app asks for the Accessibility grant instead of assuming it.** Pasting posts a synthetic ⌘V, which macOS drops without a word from an app that has no grant — and the app never asked for one. It relied on already being in Privacy & Security → Accessibility, which it was, from years back. The rename moved it to a new bundle identifier, the grant stayed with the old one, and the pane listed no Iago at all: nothing to switch on, every paste dead, and the log still cheerfully reporting `Cmd+V sent`. The check (`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions`) is what *lists* an app there, so it now runs at launch — the app introduces itself, the pane offers a switch — and again in front of every paste, which refuses instead of claiming a delivery it cannot make (`gate`, tested; the log line no longer says "sent" for a keystroke that was eaten). Copying was never affected: filing a clip needs no grant, which is why the history kept filling while nothing would paste.

**CopyPaster is now Iago** — the parrot the icon has always been, after the parrot in *Aladdin*. The name is the only thing that changed; the picture, the hotkey and the behaviour are the same. What it touched: repo (`olegperegudov/copypaster` → `olegperegudov/iago`, GitHub redirects the old URL, so installers already out in the wild keep updating), product name, bundle identifier (`com.copypaster.app` → `com.iago.app`), crate, installer file names the README buttons point at, and the signing certificate (now "Iago Code Signing"). The identifier moved on purpose rather than leaving a CopyPaster shell under an Iago label — the cost is one reinstall: macOS reads a new identifier as a different program, so the permissions are granted once more and the old clip history stays behind under the old path.

**A screenshot card shows when it was copied, not how big it is.** The foot carried the pixel size (`1028×144`) where a text card carries its age. The size is a fact about the picture; what the history is for is finding a clip again, and "20 minutes ago" is what places it. Both kinds now read the same: badge on the left, age on the right.

**Up from a card lands on that card's app.** Stepping up used to land wherever the icon cursor happened to have been left, which made "show me the rest of what this app copied" a hunt along the row for an icon that was already sitting on the card under the cursor. Now the step itself is the sentence: up from a Ghostty card puts the cursor on Ghostty and turns its filter on, so ▲▼ is the whole gesture for "only the terminal, please" — and the ▼ comes back down onto the very card it left, which is still there because the filter is that card's own app. Walk sideways off the app and the card is filtered away, so the cursor falls to the head of what is left; walk back onto it and the card is waiting under the cursor again. The mouse says the same thing: clicking an icon keeps the card that survives the filter under the cursor instead of jumping to the top.

**⌫ on the icons lets the filter go, and hands the card back.** With a query typed and the cursor up on the icon row, ⌫ went on eating letters of the query — a query that is not even next to the cursor — instead of undoing the filter the user had just put on right there. The key now reads the zone it is pressed in: on the icons it clears the filter and nothing else (with no filter to clear it does nothing — it never reaches the query from up there); on the cards it erases a letter and, with nothing left to erase, clears the filter, as before. Letting a filter go only ever brings cards *back*, so there is always a card to return to: the one the user left behind on the way up to the icons (`leftCardId`, taken at the moment of the step, because the filter then hides that card and it cannot be remembered by position). The cheat sheet's ⌫ line moved out of "Everywhere" — the key means two different things in the two zones, and saying so in one line was the bug written down. Clearing the filter from the icons also rides the cursor back *down* onto that card: with the filter gone there is nothing left up on the row to do, so hanging there was a dead end — the whole point of the key up there is to undo the step that brought you up.

**The cursor holds its card while the search moves the ground under it.** Typing happens *while* reading the cards — the user stands on the third match, adds a letter, and the cards before it disappear. The selection was pinned to the index, so it stayed on position zero and the card being read slid away; every keystroke threw the reader back to the front of the carousel. The selection now follows the clip, not the slot: `setQuery` notes which card is under the cursor, and after the list is refiltered the cursor is put back on that same card wherever it landed (`keepCursorOn` in `nav.js`, next to `clamp`/`wrap` — the same index arithmetic, kept pure and tested without a DOM). The one card that cannot be held is one the new query excludes: there is nothing to stand on, so the cursor goes back to the front, which is where the first match is. Deleting a card keeps the old behaviour on purpose — it holds the *index*, so holding ⌘⌫ walks the history away card by card instead of jumping.

**The same clip twice is one card.** Copying a snippet you already have used to file a second, identical card — and ten copies of a path you paste all day would push everything else off the fifty-card ring. Now the history recognises content it holds: the clip that is there moves back to the head, takes the new time, and takes the app it was copied from this time (an app we could not identify does not overwrite the one we knew, so the card never loses its header). The duplicate check was already there, but only against the *head* — it caught "copied twice in a row" and nothing else.

- Each clip carries a hash of its payload (`content_hash`, kind hashed with the bytes so text and an image can never look alike). The hash narrows the search; a byte compare settles it, because a collision would otherwise hand the user someone else's clip. Comparing payloads directly would mean memcmp-ing a few hundred KB of PNG against fifty clips on every clipboard change.
- The moved clip keeps its id — its image file on disk is keyed by id, and rebuilding the clip would orphan the picture.
- `add` returns whether anything changed, so re-seeing the same clip at the same second (the watcher can) costs neither a disk write nor a redraw.
- Histories written by earlier versions already carry duplicates. `restore` collapses them on load, newest copy kept, and the cleaned list is written straight back — otherwise the index would carry them forever and every launch would collapse them again.

**The search is no longer a place you go.** It was a zone between the cards and the icons: to search you walked up into it, typed, then walked back down to the cards to choose one. The keys now say what the popup is: the cursor lives on the cards and the icons and nothing else, and whatever you type goes into the search from wherever you stand. ⌥V → "assist" → ◀▶ → ⏎, in one gesture.

- The query surfaces *above* the icon row and only once there is something in it, so nothing below it moves when it appears. It is a `<span>`, not an `<input>`: nothing focusable, no click target, no arrow can walk into it. The caret is drawn.
- ⌫ now erases a letter of the query, then (with nothing left to erase) clears the app filter. Deleting a card moved off it: **⌘⌫**, the Mac idiom (Finder, Mail, every list), with ⌦ as the second way in. ⌦ alone was a bad key to land on — on a laptop it is Fn+⌫, which is not a one-handed gesture, and it is the first thing the user tried. The destructive key is no longer the one you reach for to fix a typo, and it only fires on the cards, where the selection is visible.
- Digits 1–9 paste the n-th card while the search is empty and are characters once there is a query — a key that pastes card two cannot also be how you search for "v2". Same rule as before, keyed on the query instead of the (now absent) search zone.
- The keymap moved into `keys.js` as one pure function: the rules are read and tested without a DOM, `main.js` only carries them out. The cheat sheet lost its search zone and the settings window's cheat-sheet twin shrank to 470 to fit.

**The whole interface can be sized up.** The px sizes are authored for a screen you are leaning into; the popup is read at a glance from across the desk, where they run a shade tight. A new **Interface size** slider in Settings scales everything — the popup and both sheets — through a page `zoom`, so the fixed card widths and paddings grow in step with the text instead of the text spilling out of them. The default is 110%, a touch above the authored size; the range is 85–125%.

- The factor lives in `settings.json` as `ui_scale` (`settings.rs`), clamped to the slider's ends on the way in — it drives a window resize, so a value from disk or the frontend is not trusted to be sane. An old settings file without the field reads as the default. Writing the retention no longer constructs a fresh `Settings` (that would have wiped the scale); both setters now edit the cached copy and save the whole thing.
- The ceiling is where the popup's content still fits inside its fixed 460-tall strip without the top row falling off; past it the window would have to grow too, which is a separate change. Verified by eye at 110% and 125% — nothing clipped.
- `scale.js` applies it as `document.documentElement.style.zoom` on load in every window; the popup re-reads it on each summon (`popup-opened`), so a change made in Settings while it was hidden lands the next time it opens. The two fixed sheets are grown to `base × scale` in Rust (`show_window`) so the zoomed content is not clipped by a window that stayed at 1×; the settings window's base grew to 430 to seat the new zone. Rust does the resize, so no new frontend window permission was needed.
- The slider previews live: this window opens at the saved scale, and the sample line nets the *target* scale on top of that, so a drag shows the new text size without resizing the window under the cursor. It persists once, when the drag settles.

**A settings window, and clips that expire.** The history had no notion of time: a clip lived until fifty newer ones pushed it out, which for something copied rarely is months. Now it has a retention window — a day, a week (the default), a month, or no limit — and anything past it is deleted: at startup (time passed while the app was closed), on every new clip (the app sits open for days), and immediately when the window is shortened, so cutting a month to a day does not leave yesterday's clips on screen. `MAX_ITEMS` still bounds size; retention bounds time, and they are different questions.

The tray menu gained **Settings** (a real window, same zones as the cheat sheet) and lost the loose "Screenshot straight to clipboard" tick — that switch moved inside. The cheat-sheet window's title was in Russian; the app speaks English.

`settings.json` sits next to the history, written owner-only like everything else. The retention value is checked against the offered choices in Rust — it decides what gets deleted, so it is not free text. The new window is listed in `capabilities/default.json`; without that it renders and stays mute.

**Content-Security-Policy is set** (`default-src 'self'`; no remote script, image or connection) and **every GitHub action is pinned to a commit SHA**, with the updater signing key reaching only the step that signs. The popup renders clipboard content and app icons, so an escaping bug there would have had a network to escape to; now it does not. The build jobs hold the key that signs auto-updates — a moved tag upstream would have been a signed malicious update for every user. Same change in Ribbit and Quill.

**Passwords no longer land in the history, and the history is no longer world-readable.** Two bugs, one consequence: anything running as any user on the machine could read every clip ever copied, passwords included.

- `clipboard.rs` now checks the pasteboard for the markers every password manager stamps on what it copies (`org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`, plus the transient / auto-generated pair) and drops such a clip before it reaches the history. Windows has its own flag (`ExcludeClipboardContentFromMonitorProcessing`) — same treatment. Verified against a real staged pasteboard clip, both directions: `src-tauri/tests/stage_concealed_clip.swift` + `cargo test --lib -- --ignored concealed`.
- Everything the app writes (`index.json`, `img/*.png`, `debug.log`, the atomic temp file) now goes through `private.rs`: mode 0600, folders 0700, set on the open handle so a file an older build left at 0644 is narrowed rather than kept. `std::fs::write` obeys the umask, which is 022 by default — that is where the 0644 came from. A test asserts the modes; it fails if anyone reintroduces a plain `fs::write`.

**README feature sections say what you get, not what the control is called.** "The history / Filter by app / Search / Keys" became "Everything you copied, still there / Too many clips? Narrow to the app / Or just start typing / Hands stay on the keyboard" — same screenshots, headings that read like a benefit, matching Ribbit's. The screenshot paragraph lost half its prose.

**`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` gained the Debugging section** (the `js_log` command; DevTools are off in release builds), which Ribbit's copy already had.

**The README is a shop window, not a manual.** It opens with three fat buttons that download the installer for a platform *directly*. The old page had no download button at all — the install section pointed at `/releases/latest`, so "download" meant landing in a list of files and picking the right one, and everything below it (npm, cargo, the session log path) was written for a developer.

- A direct link can only be made to a name that survives the next version bump, so CI now also uploads version-less copies of each installer (`CopyPaster_macOS_AppleSilicon.dmg`, `CopyPaster_macOS_Intel.dmg`, `CopyPaster_Windows_Setup.exe`) alongside Tauri's own assets, which the updater keeps reading.
- "Releases" now points at `/releases` (every version, so a bad build can be rolled back), not `/releases/latest` (one release and its five files — which reads as variants of the same thing).
- Stack, local build, tests, release pipeline, signing and the layout trap moved to `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

**Pasting works on a Russian keyboard layout.** Picking a card put the clip on the clipboard and then pasted nothing — silently, every time, as long as a Cyrillic layout was active.

The paste was synthesised as ⌘ + `Key::Unicode('v')`. enigo resolves that letter through the *active layout*: it walks keycodes 0–127 asking each what character it types, and takes the one that answers "v". On a Russian layout no key answers "v", the search falls through with `pressed_keycode = 0` — and keycode 0 is the A key. So the app sent **⌘A**. Nothing pasted, and the target app quietly selected all of its text instead. On ABC the same code found the V key on 9 and worked, which is why this looked intermittent rather than broken.

Measured on the machine rather than guessed: `UCKeyTranslate` over both installed layouts — *Russian – PC* has no key producing "v" (key 9 types `м`), *ABC* has it on key 9.

- ⌘V now goes out as a raw key event on the **physical** V key (`kVK_ANSI_V` = 9) with `CGEventFlagCommand` set on the event itself. The receiving app reads the chord from the event's flags, so it holds no matter which layout is active or which modifiers are physically down. Same synthesis Quill already uses for ⌘C — it hit this trap first, in terminals and Electron apps.
- Windows keeps the enigo path (`Ctrl` + Unicode `v`). It has the same layout blind spot in principle; noted, not touched blind.

Tests: the paste key is asserted to be the hardware V and explicitly *not* keycode 0 — the exact value that shipped. Note the limit: the keystroke itself crosses into another app, which no unit test here can observe.

## 0.1.14 — 2026-07-13

**Backspace deletes the card you are standing on.** The key already meant "take this away" in the other two zones — it clears the app filter, and it deletes a character in search. On the cards it did nothing, and a clip you no longer wanted could only be waited out of the ring.

- `delete_clip` drops the item and writes the index straight away, so the clip does not come back after a restart. An image clip takes its file with it: `store::save` already sweeps whatever no longer has a clip behind it.
- A stale press is harmless: an id the history has already lost returns an error instead of taking the neighbouring card with it.
- The cursor stays put, so the next card slides under it — holding the key walks the history away one card at a time.

Tests: the clip leaves the history, a second delete of the same id takes no neighbour, the image file leaves the disk. Driven end to end in a browser against the real popup code: pressed `⌫` on the middle card, the card went and the cursor kept its place.

**The icon lost its box.** The tray, Dock and DMG icons are regenerated from a transparent parrot — the way Ribbit carries its frog. The old plate with the "COPY PASTER" caption is gone.

## 0.1.9 — 2026-07-13

**The history survives a restart.** Was: clips lived in memory only — any restart, an update above all, wiped them. Now: the history sits on disk and comes back at launch.

- `index.json` — everything light (text, source app, timestamp), rewritten whole on every new clip.
- `img/<id>.png` — images as separate files: written once, instead of being rewritten from scratch every time a word is copied. The file of a clip that fell off the ring is deleted, so the history does not leak onto the disk.
- The index is written to a temp file and renamed over the old one: a half-written index is worse than a stale one, because it is what the next launch reads.
- A corrupt index means an empty history, not a crash. Clip numbering continues from the last restored id — otherwise a new clip would take someone else's number and its card would paste the wrong thing.

Tests: the round trip "saved → restored → the card hands back the same bytes", numbering continuity, cleanup of the file behind a dropped clip, corrupt index.

Clips now sit on disk in the clear (`~/Library/Application Support/copypaster/`) — the same as Paste. Passwords that pass through the clipboard settle there too.

## 0.1.8 — 2026-07-13

**The app row is a ring.** Left from the first icon lands on the last one, right from the last one lands on the first. There are few apps, so hitting a wall buys nothing: one direction walks the whole row.

**The `⌫` chip no longer shoves the icons.** Was: it stood as the first element of the row and pushed every icon sideways the moment it appeared — a jerk on every filter. Now: the chip hangs as a tab above the row, in space that is reserved whether it shows up or not, so the icons stay put.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-07-13

**The popup takes the keyboard for itself.** Was: the panel accepted keys, but the app underneath stayed active — and everything the popup did not handle itself went through to it. Esc over an open popup closed the Telegram window, not the popup. Now: while the popup is open, it is the active one; when it leaves — by Esc, by the hotkey or after a paste — the keyboard goes back to the app it was called from (by the remembered pid, exactly the way pasting already did it). There are exactly three actions over the popup: pick a card, Esc, click away.

A non-activating panel (the Spotlight mechanism) was chosen so that the paste would land in the original app. But we remember the pid anyway and hand focus back explicitly, so "never activate at all" bought nothing and leaked keys.

**Stepping up to the app row turns the filter on at once.** Was: you moved onto the icons and nothing happened — you had to press sideways as well, and only then did the "⌫ clear" chip appear. Now: a step up onto the icons is already a choice — the app under the cursor filters the cards, and the chip is visible right away.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-07-13

**The shortcuts sheet is a normal window.** Was: a frameless window on top of everything else, closable only by clicking the menu item again — it covered whatever opened after it. Now: a system frame with a close button, `⌘W` and Esc close it, and it does not float above other windows. Closing hides the window instead of destroying it, otherwise the menu item could not open it again.

**A menu item named after the result.** Was: "Instant screenshots" — the name spoke about the mechanism, not the outcome. Now: "Screenshot straight to clipboard (no thumbnail)" — ticking it removes the macOS floating thumbnail, and the capture reaches the clipboard at once instead of five seconds later.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-07-12

Fixes from the first live run.

**The elements are opaque.** Was: cards, search and the app row were see-through (72% opacity + background blur) — over a busy wallpaper the text was hard to read. Now: a solid dark background. There is still no shared backdrop under the popup — the zones keep floating over the screen, but each of them now honestly covers what is beneath it.

**A click away closes the popup** — not only Esc.
- Clicks outside the window are caught by a global mouse monitor (`NSEvent`): a non-activating panel never becomes the active app, so it never gets a "lost focus" event and there is nothing else to hang the closing on. The monitor does not see clicks inside our own window — picking a card does not close the popup from under itself. Such a monitor needs no Accessibility permission (that is only for keyboard ones).
- Clicks on the empty part of the window are caught by the popup itself: the window is a full-width strip and the desktop shows through it, so a click on empty space is a click away.
- On Windows the panel is a normal window, where focus loss fires.

**The `⌫` key is visible when there is something to clear.** Was: the app filter went on with an arrow key, and only a reader of the shortcuts sheet knew how to take it off. Now: while the filter is on, a "⌫ clear" chip sits at the left of the app row — it names the key and works as a button.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-12

A full rebuild: Swift/SwiftUI → Tauri 2 (Rust + HTML/CSS/JS).

### Why the stack changed

Updates, signing and CI for Ribbit and Quill are built on Tauri: a `latest.json` manifest in GitHub Releases, a minisign signature, a background check every 30 minutes, an auto version bump on every push to `main`. A Swift app cannot reuse that pipeline — it would need a second, separate one (Sparkle plus its own workflow). The app was small (~680 lines, half of them UI that was being rewritten anyway), so moving it onto the shared rails was cheaper than keeping two schemes alive. A Windows build came along for free.

### What it became

**Instant screenshots.** Was: a screenshot reached the clipboard in ~6.5 s, and `⌘V` right after Shift-Cmd-4 pasted the previous clip. Now: ~1.5 s, and with the floating thumbnail off — immediately.
- The macOS floating thumbnail (~5 s) is the bulk of the delay: while it hangs there, the file is not on disk yet. The "Instant screenshots" menu item turns it off.
- The screenshots folder is watched through filesystem events instead of a poll once a second (−1 s).
- A screenshot goes straight into the history, skipping the detour "put it on the clipboard → wait for our own clipboard poll" (−0.5 s).

**A popup instead of a list of lines.** Was: a 280×280 vertical list, one truncated line per clip, images squashed into 80×40. Now: three elements floating over the screen with no shared backdrop — a carousel of cards, a search field, an app row.
- A card shows the content, the source app with its icon, the kind and the age of the clip.
- Live search: filters from the first letter, matches highlighted in fuchsia (`#c25cce` — the same mark and the same "match at the start of a word" rule as Ribbit's log search).
- App filter: the arrow lands on an app and the cards narrow, no Enter needed. `⌫` clears the filter and takes focus down into search.
- Navigation on two axes: up and down between zones, left and right inside a zone. Each zone remembers where the cursor stood.
- The popup is a non-activating NSPanel: it accepts the keyboard but does not pull focus from the app underneath, so the paste lands where you were working.

**A menu-bar menu.** Check for updates (once one is found — "Update to vX.Y.Z", and the icon turns green), Shortcuts, Instant screenshots, the version, quit.

**A shortcuts sheet** — a separate window that highlights the zone you are standing in: the same key does different things in different zones (digits pick a card — or get typed into search; `⌫` deletes a character — or clears the filter).

**Signing.** A stable self-signed certificate, "CopyPaster Code Signing" (as in Ribbit): the Accessibility permission binds to the certificate rather than to the build hash, and survives updates. An ad-hoc signature would make the user grant it again after every release.

### Tests

- Rust: the history — order, dedup of consecutive duplicates, size limit, preview truncation.
- JS: word-prefix search, highlighting, HTML escaping (a copied `<img onerror=…>` must not run inside a card), filters and their combination, the counters in the app row.
